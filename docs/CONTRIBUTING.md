## Development Environment Setup

Currently, Eclipse is the supported IDE for development of Major Tom. It is recommended to create an isolated workspace for StarChart Labs projects. You should also import the standard StarChart Labs formatting and save settings from the [eclipse-configuration repository](https://github.com/StarChart-Labs/eclipse-configuration)

## General Standards

In general, pull requests should:
- Be small and focused on a single improvement/bug
- Include tests for changed behavior/new features
- Match the formatting of the existing code
- Have documentation for added methods/classes and appropriate in-line comments
- Have additions to the CHANGE_LOG.md file recording changed behavior

## Running Serverless Locally

To run a serverless deployment, you must npm install a couple serverless plug-ins, as well as serverless itself:

```
npm install serverless
npm install --save-dev serverless-iam-roles-per-function
npm install --save-dev serverless-pseudo-parameters
```
